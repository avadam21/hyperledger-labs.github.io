_The Giving Chain_

# Short Description
_The Giving Chain is a Social Impact project created by the Hyperledger Princeton Meetup. The Purpose of the project is to decentralize local charity giving by creating the Giving Chain and the R2D application. The application will use participants cell phones  to create an asset to be donated. The R2D (Recipient to Donor) then notifies the participant in the giving chain that an asset has been created and ready to be donated. The asset is then track till it is received by someone with need. This donation system lets donors track donation as well as creating a dignified way in which people can receive assistance._

# Scope of Lab
_To create a Social Impact blockchain project that matches donors and recipients by creating user interfaces,  available on smartphones,  to track and trace donations.  Donors will tag a photo of a donation to track while the donation is transported to the recipient._
